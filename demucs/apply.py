    Apply model to a given mixture.

    Args:
        shifts (int): if > 0, will shift in time `mix` by a random amount between 0 and 0.5 sec
            and apply the opposite shift to the output. This is repeated `shifts` time and
            all predictions are averaged. This effectively makes the model time equivariant
            and improves SDR by up to 0.2 points.
        split (bool): if True, the input will be broken down in 8 seconds extracts
            and predictions will be performed individually on each and concatenated.
            Useful for model with large memory footprint like Tasnet.
